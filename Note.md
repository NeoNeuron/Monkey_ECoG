**map10.mat:** The element of matrix A_ij represents the weights from channel i to channel j. In total, there are 126 channels to 10 channels. 
    The element of matrix equaling to 1.5 means the channel i and channel j both belong to the same region. 
    Please fell free to contact with me if you have any question.

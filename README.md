# Mutual Information Estimation

##Adaptive partitioning algorithm for mutual information estimation

Python implementation of mutual information estimation, where adaptive partitioning strategy is applied.

**ATTENTION:** This algorithm is designed for mutual information estimation between continuous variables. Applying it to discrete variables with few number of values might lead to large deviations. Modules for finite discrete cases are to be developed.
